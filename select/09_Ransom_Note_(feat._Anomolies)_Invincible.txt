Storm up to the door thinking that we kicking down using a Trojan Horse
It won't open with force, our moments short, so what's the last resort?
Picking the lock – plan B skeleton key sticking
Covered up in gloves and hats so they can't match our description
A.N.S. masked marauders
Hip hop's Doctors Without Borders
Operation: No More Lies
Kidnaps the daughter of a media mogul
Who hijacked the hip hop game
We took her to close the gap
We demand a prisoner exchange
Now, run in the back room. Don't nobody say shit
Helixx C grab that chick before she runs quick
Don't worry 'bout her man, he done made me mad
Fold that nigga like a dress shirt and throw him in a duffel bag
In the hummer now we're off as I proudly thought my crew
Initiates the long awaited media coup
A car passes blastin' music from the bullshit charts
Ain't no turning back from here, ANOMOLIES is going hard

There's been a big kidnapping
She screamed when the men burst in and started beating her fiance
The young heiress was forced into the trunk of a white car
Police say the whole thing was carried out with commando-like precision
What we received in the mail today appears to be a seven page statement plus a tape recording
And according to the demands, which we'll outline here, it says all these things must be publicized in full
Which is what we're doing now

Now, listen up people: This is our communiqué
If you want your daughter, be wise and do just what we say
Tell the truth, you own both right wing AMs full of haters
And the FMs who cater to the lowest common denominator
Tell the truth about payola-based quotas and your motives
To hold our attention so you sell it to the highest donor
Truth is, your companies wanting to stifle freedom of speech
Cause without neutrality, the net will filter what you see
We resorted to these tactics cause you know you can afford it
We demand our own stations so our voices ain't distorted
We demand you break bread for the babies – they need educating
Updated books and computers for the future they're creating
We demand that you give us our wireless citywide
And make it free so we can truly end the digital divide
We demand that you stop making hip hop commercialized
Before it meets its own demise by the devil in disguise

Dad, I'm ok, I just hope that you'll do what they say, dad, and do it quickly
I just want you to know that I'm going to do everything I can to get you out of there
It's a little frightening because the initial demand is one that's impossible to meet
However, in the next 24-48 hrs I'll be trying my best to come back with some kind of a counter offer that's acceptable

A station, they said you could have it right here
Fill out this bureaucratic nightmare
They'll tell us if it's up to standard in 5 years
Gave excuses, no books or computers for the youth
Free stickers and hats to every single public school
They said they're giving us the wireless, it's trash
Taxing us with hidden fees they profit while we crash
Just because you throw a bone, that don't make it grub
Rap stars and Nascar, that's not what we asked for
You want your daughter? Come and get her
But when he arrived, surprise! All that he found was a letter
She said, "Pops, I've known since I've been grown
You hijacked the minds of the masses, gave 'em Stockholm syndrome
I helped ANOMOLIES plot all along
To take your monopoly spot, and while you're reading this we're gone."
Creating our own outlets even if it ain't out yet
Seeing typical trends through a critical lens
Making media, music, so you have no influence
Mobilizing a movement so your brainwashing is useless

There's an opportunity for a new society to be built
On people who are transforming themselves
And who are not just opposing those that oppress them
