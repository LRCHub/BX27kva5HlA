He softly told you everything
He never knew you didn't care
Break his heart again, smile and prepare
For all the words he screams
Give him a reason
Anything but silence or the truth

He'll hate you now
Remember how he held you for
All those lonely nights
You know you shared and remember
How you never cared about anything he said
Well now he's dead to you
So bury him instead

Word's out I'm not the man I used to be
You knew it all along
That I felt this way
I put in this song
Tear me apart for pouring out my heart
You know it wouldn't phase you in the least

I hate you now
Remember how I held you for
All those lonely nights
You know we shared and remember
How you never cared about anything I said
Now I'm dead to you
So bury me instead

So here's the one
(About every heart you stole)
You're so sure
(That you're not a thief at all)
Because I'm the one who's stealing you
But this ransom's overdue
And everything that's in me says that
I hate you now

Remember how I held you for
All those lonely nights
You know we shared and remember
How you never cared about anything I said
And now I'm dead to you
So bury me instead
